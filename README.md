# OccupancyModeling_Stan
Species/Site occupancy modeling with Stan in R


Lahoz-Monfort et al (2016) applied the Royle & Link (2006) occupancy-modeling framework to environmental DNA. Here, I've taken their code for Bayesian estimation of the relevant parameters and ported it to Stan from JAGS.  I have also generalized it to apply to multiple species or multiple sites per species. 

Comments welcome, of course.
